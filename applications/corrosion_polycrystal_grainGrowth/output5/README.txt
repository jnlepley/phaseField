So, we skipped grain 0 (good, that is the electrolyte), and it seems to have been able to locate grain 1, but not grain 2? I will try re-running this again (no change in code or parameters) on a single processor to ensure that the output is clear about whether grain 1 was actually located, or it was attempting to locate it and grain 2 at the same time and failed at either of them.
